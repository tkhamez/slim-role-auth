# Role-based authorization

Middleware for the [Slim 3](http://www.slimframework.com/) framework.

## Installation

With Composer:

```
composer require tkhamez/slim-role-auth
```

## Usage

Example:

```php
use Tkhamez\Slim\RoleAuth\SecureRouteMiddleware;
use Tkhamez\Slim\RoleAuth\RoleMiddleware;

$app = new Slim\App();

// Deny access if a required role is missing
$app->add(new SecureRouteMiddleware(
    [
        // route pattern -> roles, first "starts-with" match is used
        '/secured/public' => ['any'],
        '/secured'        => ['user'],
    ],
    ['redirect_url' => null] // optionally add "Location" header instead of 403 status code
));

// Add roles to request attribute
$app->add(new RoleMiddleware(
    new RoleProvider(), // must implement RoleProviderInterface
    ['route_pattern' => ['/secured']] // optionally limit to these routes
));
```

- The `SecureRouteMiddleware` denies access to a route if the required role is missing in the `roles` 
  request attribute.
- The `RoleMiddleware` class adds the `roles` attribute to the request object with roles provided by the 
  `RoleProvider` class.
- You can add several role providers for different paths.

This needs the Slim setting `determineRouteBeforeAppMiddleware` set to true.

For more information, see the inline documentation for the classes.
